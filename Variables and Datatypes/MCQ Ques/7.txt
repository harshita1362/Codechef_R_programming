Guess the Output
Guess the output of following code
x <- 2147483647L
y <- 2147483648L
cat(class(x),class(y),sep="\n")
Note : Largest integer that can be stored is 2^32 - 1 = 2147483647

integer
numeric
Largest integer that can be stored in integer type is 2^32 - 1, 
so any number greater than that will be automatically typecasted into numeric type.
