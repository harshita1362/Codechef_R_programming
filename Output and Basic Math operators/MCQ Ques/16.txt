Print 1 to 5
How do you print the numbers 1 to 5 on the same line with spaces ( without line number ) ?

Correct Answer:
cat(paste(1:5, sep = " "))
Colon ( from : to ) operator in R is used to generate regular sequences in the range [from,to].
Wrapping the paste function by cat ensures that line number is not printed.
